# **Credit Risk Analytics (Bondora Bank)**

This repository contains the major project work completed as part of a data science internship at Evoastra Ventures Pvt Ltd. The project focuses on analyzing and predicting credit risk for Bondora Bank using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to identify patterns that indicate a client's likelihood of defaulting on a loan, aiding in better risk management decisions.

## **Project Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
The project addresses two critical challenges in the lending industry:
1. **Risk of Loan Approval:** Identifying applicants who are likely to default and minimizing the financial risk associated with lending.
2. **Business Loss Due to Rejection:** Ensuring that applicants capable of repaying loans are not rejected, thereby avoiding business loss.

### **Objectives**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the driving factors behind loan default.
- Develop insights from the data to inform lending decisions, such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates to risky applicants.
- Present actionable insights to improve credit risk management.

## **Data Description**

The dataset comprises three key files:
1. **application_data.csv:** Contains client information at the time of loan application, including payment difficulties.
2. **previous_application.csv:** Provides details of previous loan applications, including statuses like Approved, Cancelled, Refused, or Unused.
3. **columns_description.csv:** A data dictionary explaining the variables present in the datasets.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization Tool:** Power BI (used for enhanced data visualization in the presentation)
